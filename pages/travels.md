##Title

I'm lucky enough to have done a bit of travelling in my childhood. 

One of the most memorable trips I took was out to Glacier National Park in Montana. We drove as any midwestern family would do and made many stops along the way. One of them was at the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota. Considering I visited when it was very small underfunded venture. It was heartwarming to see how much the museum had expanded. They had an option to purchase a small rock that had been chipped away while carving and all profits went directly back into the memorial.

Another stop on that trip was in Butte, Montana. A very lovely town with a very rich history in mining. 

##Family Gifts
My sister is lucky enough to have a job where she gets to travel quite a bit. 

As someone who struggles to find gifts for people when I travel someplace, I feel better knowing I will never put that stress on anybody.

My brother is also currently in Mexico near Guadelejara. My parents went to visit and brought back some more rocks from the Colima Volcano which apparently which has some strenuous hiking trails around it.

### Basic Geology Facts
There are three categories of rocks: sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic. 

## Sedimentary
Sedimentary rock is formed by the compression of particles of other rocks and the remains of organisms.

## Igneous
When magma or lava cools and solidifies, igneous rock is formed. 

## Metamorphic
Metamorphic rock, as the name suggests, is rock undergoing some sort of metamorphisis, oftentimes high pressures and temperatures.  

## Minerals
Minerals form the basis of all rocks and are formed under a complex process involving pressure and/or evaporation that oftentimes takes place over millions of years.
